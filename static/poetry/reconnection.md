A sea of people in high dimensional space
moving randomly; the magnitude of difference constantly changing.
Change is the only constant.

A gap like an uncrossable chasm—
the cliffs slowly and magically moving closer.
A shaky bridge, formed through childhood innocence and a want for connection
collapsing after years of neglect
being rebuilt with trust and sincerity.

Reminiscing; 
a beautiful painting seen from afar
fuzzy from distance
its elegance thick in the air.

Conversing;
a wealth of bonding
leading to mutual respect and affection.

Reflecting;
a sharper view of an unclear past that
uncovers treasure troves of understanding.

Grateful for the chasm
that taught me how to build bridges
