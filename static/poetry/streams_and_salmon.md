*shhhhhhh*
Streams: safe, easy, 
continuous
Leaves glide like professional skaters
Fish swim but are actually more
escorted down stream
Who would go against the stream?

The salmon would go against the stream.
in their crazy, weird mentality, salmon fight to the tooth
to swim against the current
the strong current—the all-powerful current
Bruised, 
battered,
cooked (as I would say),
they continue
they never falter

Change is real and change is happening and change is
reachable.
Be the change maker
Swim against the current
Or, even better, evolve legs and walk on the land.
escape the stream
