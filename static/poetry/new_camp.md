New camp, new me;
or so they say, at least something similar.
I think it’s wrong.
The kids are new, the friends are new, the people are new
the fun is new, even the food is new.
But in every smile, thought, story—
I’m reminded of my past.
To be clear, it's a good thing and I like it.

In the classes a young me answers a question with confidence;
or without.
During play time a past I chases after a laughing peer.
At lunch a young I looks around the cafe,
nervously looking for a spot to sit at.
During an activity a past me struggles to make progress,
but nonetheless musters up a valiant effort.

I see the past, but can I see the future?
It's questionable.
I like sharing past experiences as advice, but
everyone is different.
young people are like butterflies, exploring the world in a joyful saunter—
the unlimited potential being both
amazing,
and stressful.

Be yourself.
I guess in the new camp, I'll just be me. Old, new, and all.
