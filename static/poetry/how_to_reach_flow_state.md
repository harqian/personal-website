step one, orientation.
 prepare yourself: squash distractions, maintain your body, fix your posture.
 start working, tell yourself to be focused.
 the strong grow stronger through discomfort, not complacency.
 monitor your status: how much progress have I made? am I being distracted?
 I sure hope I’m not being distracted; I need to reach flow state.

step two, entry.
 now that we are clear on expectations, grind mindlessly.
 don’t think, just do.
 you stop hearing birds at your window—no more shhhh of wind in trees.
 someone texts you and your phone lights up, but 
 you don’t notice.

step three, flow.
 a, b, c, x, y, z
 projects, assignments, math problems.
 ultra‑efficient multitasking genius,
 dopamine city.

step four, closure and a beginning.
 all flowing streams come to an end—often, a crashing end.
 wow, that was amazing. and a bit overwhelming.
 keep working or take a break.
 go on with your life, incrementally building an idea of
 how to reach flow state.
