one two three,
oh yeah. four.

one is most urgent so we start on it first.
hit a delay—start number two.
two is going well, but one is ready again.
dilemmas.

go back to one because it needs to be done today—think about two in the back of your mind.
grind one; you get fully immersed in the experience and are ready to enter flow state but

"Alex!"
"What, Mom?" you (Alex) say.
"You need to do the dishes."

great. run downstairs and start washing the dishes.
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven
*scrub scrub scrub*
eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen
*rattle rattle rattle*
**clank**

back into your room.
continue one and finish it; start two again.
where were we?
day dream about saving your family from a robber.
finish two and think about three and four. (what was four again?)
oh right, four is like the monster under your bed, slowing creeping up on you but unapproachable.
you have tried to finish it three times already and failed.

confront four to be brave in case somehow your crush is watching.
think about them instead of working on four.
make progress on four, but it’s time to sleep.
dilemmas.

get ready to sleep and try to sleep, but cant; go back to work.
make more progress on four, but it’s really time to sleep now. push through
spend another hour and finish four like a champion.

go to sleep content
serene
