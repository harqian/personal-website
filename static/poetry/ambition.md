like an evil witch it flies from
the skies
and
Attacks you, seizes you, entraps you.
as a swift bird, it runs away…

Eventually the cycles repeat enough for you to 
see the truth
What is the truth, you may ask
the truth is

Grabbing it with all you have and not letting go
It tries to resist, but you pull
out your handcuffs.
constraining orders this, house arrest that
it cannot leave

*Ambition is the thing with wings*
The heavenly all-doer and all-motivator
*Ambition is the thing with wings*
Grab it when you can—don’t let it fly away.
