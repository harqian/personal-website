- breath work
- bathroom/wash hands
- sleep
- hang out (from ur knees) (bloodflow)
- **talk with active people**
- reflecting (just thinking about stuff and staring into space)
- reflecting (looking at past notes and seeing how i feel about them; adding to them)

*really itchy, hot, etc*
- shower
- go outside and breathe

*generally:*
- eat fruit
- blast music in ears
- look back at really old notes or just thoughts from a couple of days ago
