asking out girls & looking for collaborators for projects is very similar (how happy something makes you if you got it is inversely proportional to how sad you would be if you didnt get it)
- there is a spectrum for “how happy x would make you” that is equal to max - “how sad you would be if you did not get x”
- thus they are negatively correlated
- both girls and collaborators give you a really good connection
- thus generally afraid of putting it out there
- getting rejected sucks and isnt just nothing (esp to state of mind)
- but is probs much less than i think
- can get over really easily
- thus reach out more :)
