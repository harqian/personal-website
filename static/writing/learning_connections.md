# Preface

Here is a brain dump of many different ideas that I think are connected. These are ideas that I have used in my learning (as I do love learning), and have been useful for me to understand my processes of learning. I’d love to hear if anyone else has very different ways of thinking about this\! (for obvious reasons if you read one of the later sections)

# Why learn?

Isn’t it interesting that in most countries, the norm is for young children to spend between 8 to 14 years of their lives (\!\!\!) in school? It’s almost like governments think education is important. 

Knowledge is power in so many ways; pepole in school are so privileged to have this amazing opportunity to learn in a critical period in their life. As people grow up, they geneally get less and less time to just gather knowledge.[^1]

Not having an open mindset is like staying in a single room for your entire life. There are just so many different insightful, crazy, fun, eyeopening, sad, exciting, captivating, angering, electrifying, dangerous things out in the world to see\![^2]

# Understanding in learning

My idea of understanding arises from learning math; there is a difference between memorization and comprehension of lets say formulas that drives my definition of understanding. To me, it is a complete (intuitive and detailed) perception of an idea that allows for extrapolation and connection building. It has made my memory of the idea much better, and allowed me to be autonomous with my application of the idea.

It’s a big principle during my own learning—a consistent goal I have had for the classes I take is to understand the class content and any other important ideas well. This has extrapolated to my teaching as well. For example, when teaching my friend Precalculus, I would explain something but always ask him to demonstrate the technique through independent work; I would refuse to help him when I was trying to gauge his understanding of a certain topic.[^3]

# Gaining understanding

The ways that I see myself gaining this understanding is through new perspectives, connections. Going back to learning math, understanding Calculus deeply required a lot of new thinking and connections.[^4]

The new thinking included concepts like differentials, limits, smoothness, fundamental attributes of rates of change, accumulation convergence, and approximations. Without opening my scope of experience to these ideas, I would not have been able to understand Calculus well, because they are so fundamental to what Calculus is all about. 

Not only that, I needed to connect them. 

* differentials and limits come up in derivatives and integrals  
* rates of change, approximations are so present in real life  
* approximations are used in derivatives, integrals, limits, series,   
* convergence is basically a limit  
* real life systems have convergence conditions as well  
* approximations are expected to converge to the correct answer  
* smoothness is defined by limits  
* smoothness is just keep your pen on the paper (asymptotes, holes, jumps)  
* fundamental theorem of calculus connects rates of change and accumulation (integrals)  
* limits are really related to infinity (“what will happen if i just keep dividing 1 by 2 over and over again?”)  
* accumulation can be seen as pouring water into a tub or moving with a certain speed

By broadening my scope of ideas and connecting them (between themselves and to things I previously understood), I understood Calculus. From there, I was able to apply it to many different problems (cs, physics, bio, chem, other math), connect it to new things I learn, start understanding things that require Calculus as a prerequisite, use it as a way to think about life and many things that happen in life, and talk about it with others\!

# perspective is absurd

Instances of crazy perspective difference phenomena:

* music  
  * hearing a really good song for the first time is so different from hearing it after you’ve already heard it a bunch  
  * people liking different music  
    * my perspective is so stuck that I can’t understand how people like other songs  
* sports  
  * watching v.s. playing is SOOOOO different  
  * experienced v.s. new is SOOOOO different  
    * ex: explaining frisbee throw or explaining tennis stroke  
    * experienced players have way too much muscle memory and intuition training from spending time playing  
      * many times its really hard to explain a lot of the muscle memory and intuition because its so baked into me  
* general explanation (not just sports)  
  * humans to aliens  
    * such a gap in understanding  
  * math, cs, ml  
* calling my teachers by their first names; maybe people who are used to being called by mr or ms take their first name like my teachers would take a degrading insult?  
* people are so different its hard to understand whats going on from their perspective[^5]  
  * their entire lives with all the experiences in it were completely different from mine  
  * if im shaped by my experiences, i should logically be completely different from other people  
  * thus generally they dont think like me at all  
* different people are good at different things  
  * should be really careful about saying stuff like “x is so bad” bc i do y which is also bad  
  * also they might not think x is bad or y is bad or any combination of them  
* going crazy  
  * “mental illness”? that's just a different perspective that you don't like  
  * also their perspectives are really interesting and different  
* “ideas of different languages in different philosophies” \- cool person  
  * translating ideas to rationalist framework  
  * at first didnt really buy the argument and didnt really understand the ideas because of my framework  
  * arguments surrounding pleasure etc  
    * you are restricting your happiness; for what?  
    * more important things: school, community  
* basically: people with different values have very different perspectives  
* people who haven’t experienced something powerful are just very different from those that have  
* believe something thus dont criticize/question it  
  * crazy perspective diff of me as a rationalist explaining why logic is at the bottom of the stack, and just glossing over it  
  * funny explaining thing where I completely misunderstand the thing but think i understand it (oscilloscope / IMU)  
* we normalize so quickly, hard to see two perspectives in ones own experiences  
  * ex: stomach ache or sick, as soon as it happens it becomes hard to imagine what its like without it and vice versa  
* once understand a thing its hard to see what it was like when not understanding it

The common lesson from all of these is that new perspectives are valuable, because they allow us to see things more clearly, shake off a lot of our biases, and understand more things in general, especially things that are not obvious at all).[^6]

Another cool application of perspective is the fact that framing is powerful. I can choose to frame a certain project as something with a lot of potential and possible correctness instead of a boring and repetitive application problem that I have gotten incorrect many times in the past,[^7] which will directly increase my passion for and willingness to work on it (optimism). Similarly, in the mornings, I can tell myself that bad things might happen throughout the day, and I should be prepared for them, which will make me more ready to ground myself when they do happen (pessimism). Both are powerful techniques.

Furthermore, since new perspectives are powerful, a source of productivity for teams is revealed: more people means more perspectives.

# connection is also absurd

The crazy thing about them is that they have the uncanny ability to make me quickly understand things. This happens because I don’t have to spend time understanding something from scratch, it’s just “x but y” or “x in the context of z” or “x with w added onto it” or “x generalized”. 

Another crazy thing about it is that it organizes information really well, so they create graphs with information nodes that take individual pieces of understanding and combine them in a crazy quadratic connection network that creates higher level understanding that is much more powerful.

Categories of connections:

* patterns  
  * some repeated many times  
  * some only repeated a couple of times  
* generalizations  
* strategies  
* relation  
* categories (T)

Specific examples of my experience with connection:

* understanding boston in parts, seeing how things connect  
  * first couple of times being uber’ed home, thought i was going through some kind of back channel, but it was the main one  
  * popping up in bunker hill community college, knowing exactly how to go home (because been through there before)  
* understanding the world in parts  
  * math concepts and structures  
  * cs concepts and structures  
  * engineering  
  * econ, history, english, chem, bio, physics, anything  
  * also general skills, they all fit together to one big network  
* Tenses in grammar  
  * instead of past simple, past continuous, past perfect, … future perfect continuous where each has a definition and usage,  
  * three categories: past, present, future  
  * different modifiers can apply: continuous and perfect  
    * continuous means doing things for a certain amount of time  
    * perfect means the thing was happening and then sometime after, another thing happened  
  * also cool to see diagrams from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCiG6rlk2Bc) to show relations in time  
* visual patterns and connections for piano, ukulele, chess  
* english and history essays, evidence based argumentative writing \<-\> research papers, cover letters, pitches (both entrepreneurial and not), arguments in general  
* applying math to life in non computational ways, but ideational ways  
  * vectors in certain directions (like the word embeddings but for \=ideas= (could be anything))  
  * “spaces” (search space, action space, idea space)  
  * MECES, direct sums  
  * orthagonality  
  * sum types, product types \<-\> products of v spaces, direct sums of v spaces  
  * abstraction in math is similar in other places  
  * (gives you language to describe phenomena, just like other things)  
* ideas from one sport to another  
* green’s theorem \<-\> fundamental theorem of calculus \<-\> fundamental theorem of line integrals \<-\> stokes theorem  
* remembering names is just a relation from face to string  
* all models are wrong, the more comprehensive it is the less wrong it is (finally understand that)  
  * considering modeling prob a frisbee team will win a given point  
  * some sum of probs given turns  
  * can model offense points as a distribution of probabilities, or model offense after 0 turns, offense after 1 turn, etc as different probability distributions  
* pattern: performing well under pressure  
  * math, cs, stem  
  * singing, music  
  * sports  
* pattern for calc and mvc: when you are in a tiny reference frame, linear approximations are always correct  
* category theory to connection in general (types of connection (functors), objects (objects))

# good source of perspective and connection: people, new experiences

## New experiences

Experiencing new things gives you more perspective and lets you connect the experience / understanding gained to previous experiences. It’s a great way to learn.

They also get your brain active, because humans were built to constantly adapt to new environments. For example, when I went to [Math In the Mountains](https://www.moonflowers.xyz/writing/math_in_the_mountains), I was really inspired by the people and environment there, which prompted me to think about and try a lot of new things like a camp that I could make, what to do with friends at home, updates to my website, reflection, gratitude, addiction (I wrote it while at camp), cool math puzzles, and teaching strategies. At an internship with [Orbit Engineering](https://www.linkedin.com/company/themagicfactory/), I thought about many more: intentionality driven work, giving feedback, improvement, fulfillment, discomfort, more reflection (wrote it), connection (this).

Examples of new experiences that were cool to understand:

* wearing glasses, might switch to contacts \-\> understand how people with glasses feel  
* coffeehouse was an extremely unpleasant experience but taught me so much more than something pleasant

Engaging in new experiences can also help you discover new tools, people, or routines that really benefit you; an example being (and this is definitely not the most important thing exploration has given me, it's just a really clear example) when I realized there is a route from my house to my closest caltrain station that halves the time of commute.

## People for perspective \+ new ideas

Where do I get perspective and new ideas? People. It’s crazy insightful just to see how different people see the world (because it is so different), and spending time with them achieves that. Additionally, in discussion, ideas will be developed that are completely unique\!

# epilogue

This felt like a bit of a brain dump so take what you can out of it 🙂. I guess what I’m trying to say is that learning is good and these are ways that I learn. Learning doesn’t just come from school, and learning can happen everywhere. It’s so ubiquitous that right now it’s mainly what drives my life. Thanks for coming to my ted talk.

[^1]:  However, it’s also interesting to note that humans are learning machines, so whatever you spend time on, you learn.

[^2]:  I see this happening to my past self: many things that my parents told me to do when I was little are so astoundingly good: find things that make you happy and have meaning, learn, explore, your time is finite, avoid addiction (this one is questionable), stop and slow down and think, have friends everywhere. I never listened to them when I was little.

[^3]:  While working at Mathnasium last year, the owner of the store actually brought this idea up at an instructor meeting and highlighted my insistence on checking the kids’ understanding before letting them move on. 

[^4]:  Closer to the present, I was studying multi-variable Calculus this summer, and having a good understanding of Calculus really helped expedite that process while still maintaining good standards of learning—so understanding stacks\!

[^5]:  thus generally don't assume; “be kind, as everyone is fighting a hard battle”

[^6]:  “A new language is a new window from which to look at the world.” This quote has inspired me to put more effort into learning language at school.
