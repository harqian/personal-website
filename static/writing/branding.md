Branding is crucial for everything, whether it is a program, project, product, individual, event, opportunity, service, or idea. It completely shapes how people perceive, remember, and connect with what you're offering. You may be saying, “*Sure, it is important, but why is it crucial?*” It is crucial because it is basically the thing. Let me explain.

You have an idea of the thing in your brain. Let’s say you now tell me about it. The idea in my brain that corresponds to your thing is not inherently accurate to your thing and is usually far off from it. By altering your branding, you are controlling my perception of the thing.

Ex: I have previously enjoyed playing tennis, but my friend has not, so I need to describe my joy in more detail to her so that I can convince her to play tennis with me.
