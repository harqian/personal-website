# Intro

This essay is not written to convince you to reflect, it is written to convey my experiences reflecting.

Starting in middle school, I was always met with opportunities to reflect on my growth and learning. I never did. I always thought it was dumb, and never understood why I was always forced to reflect. Now I have seen that generally it is so immensely positive that it's probably the most valuable idea in my life right now. Practicing it everyday makes me the happy person that I am.

# Why its good

The thesis of reflection is that **understanding and clarity is generally good**. This is definitely true when I am optimizing for a goal or solving a problem, but also gaining more and more understanding of the world makes me incredibly happy. Reflection is the tool that allowed me to attain this understanding and clarity.

The world is an ever-changing ocean of things, ideas, people, experiences. Through reflection—thinking about these things, ideas, people, and experiences—I have slowly built up a great understanding of the world that I constantly improve and refine. 

I imagine myself before reflecting as a person in a dark room trying to find their phone. I couldn’t really see, so I would have to stay close to the walls and feel my way forwards. I would reach down periodically to search for my phone. Reflecting was simply the act of turning on the lights.[^1] It gave me clarity on what I want, what would help or prevent me from achieving what I want, and what kind of progress I have.

It’s not just a zero-to-one, it’s repeated zero-to-ones each more powerful than the last by an order of magnitude. I wrote a version of this essay a month ago, and now looking at it, I have grown so much beyond what I used to be—there are so many things I need to change and add to have the state of the essay reflect my current state of thought.

## Gaining understanding of the world

**Understanding things makes learning much easier.** I will write something later on this—the importance of understanding over plainly memorizing knowledge—so this section will be relatively light, but the general gist is that understanding gives me intuition, which is powerful when I need to make split second decisions or generate knowledge on my own, but also because that intuition is most likely transferable to other ideas in the field, the field as a whole, and/or other fields. Once I have this kind of understanding and intuition, learning becomes simple and only an exercise.[^2] I have found that understanding ideas on an intuitive level also helps me remember them better. I interact with infinite ideas every single day, but if I don’t record them and think about them they will just fall out of your brain like a sieve.

**Reflection typically allows the formalization and understanding of important patterns**. Before thinking deeply and writing about addiction, my relationship with it was vague. I didn’t really know what was going on, only that it was sometimes causing problems with the things I wanted to do. Through intentionally thinking and writing about the role of addiction in my life, I have realized many important things about my relationship with addiction. This allowed me to fight it with intention, and quickly, my relationship with it became much more clearly defined, easy to manage, and beneficial. A positive indicator is that many patterns I have found through reflection have also been discussed by others in various videos, talks, blog posts, or in casual conversation. 

These patterns can range from “community and connection are almost always very positive in my life” to “being honest and open creates trust which accelerates connection” to “its really interesting how ideas are generally very interconnected so the overall understanding per unit-wise understanding is much greater than linear” to “exerting more effort feels good and is logical” to “many times when I am in a very unproductive state, I don’t realize it” to “I often categorize people into people that I respect (which I overestimate) and people that I don’t (which I underestimate)” to “poetry is a really great way to concisely represent great ideas in an artistic way”. I like making sense of the world through patterns, so I like practicing reflection in this way.

## Gaining understanding of my life (my place in the world)

**Understanding of the self is deeply satisfying and empowering.** Around a week ago, I broadly traced the progression of my thinking over the course of my entire life. By doing this, I realized that much of my life was spent relatively unconsciously, living by my instincts and urges, never stopping to think. I feel that I have gained a whole new dimension of thought and feel extremely confident to live my life in the future.

**Understanding propels ever-improvement**. Understanding myself allows me to see my actions and underlying mechanisms for action clearly, which makes modifying them easy. Then, it just becomes an easy game of act, reflect, modify, repeat that is the mantra of reinforcement learning. Important to note is that while this idea is rooted in many organism’s lives, it is almost always unconscious and uncontrolled. A good example of this is addiction; you do a thing that gives you pleasure, and your brain uses that pleasure as a proxy for goodness and then trains you to keep doing that thing. It’s important that this mechanism of reinforcement learning is conscious and controlled, so that it can be properly aligned to what actually makes you happy and also optimized for speed and effectiveness. A good example of this is learning from your mistakes.

**Understanding improves memory of my life.** When something interesting happens to me and I don’t remember it, I lose out on a part of my personal history. Recently I have been looking back at middle school: projects I did, interactions I had, thoughts I generated, writing I wrote, pictures I took. The experience was very positive and allowed me to get a glimpse into what felt like years of lost history. To this day, I still feel like much of my past is locked behind closed doors because I was not that self aware back then. This allowed me to remember past positive experiences to bolster my confidence and well being, remember past negative experiences to avoid them and learn from them, and to **tell my story to inspire and benefit others[^3]**. This last point is particularly important because it allows me to create value for others, show people an authentic version of myself[^4], and practice communication by effective methods.

# Things I have done with it

Here are ideas that I have considered through reflection that are important in my life.

# What I do

## Guidelines 

**I am honest to myself.** I am a firm believer that the best way to improve is to accurately understand yourself, and lying to yourself completely destroys that. Through being honest with myself can I actually deeply understand the forces in my life and how I am reacting to them. Through being honest with myself can I really grow and make changes to my life effectively and healthily. Over the years, this guideline has become very instinctual to me. 

**I am consistent.** Sometimes reflection becomes a chore for me, especially when I am pressed hard for time. However, each and everytime I have spent extra time thinking about something even just a little longer, I always benefit. Almost always, there is a pareto to be found. 

**I review and add often.** Though I have many note docs, I review them often to constantly think about them and also reorganize them. Additionally, whenever I have a new thought to add, I just write it in. This is what allows me to really remember my thoughts as well as think deeper about my ideas because of the gap between thinking where my brain is subconsciously processing the information.[^6]

**I share.** In alignment with my value of community and new perspectives, I believe that others ground me and my ideas incredibly well and give them meaning in directions I could have never thought of. 

## Strategies

**Daily note.** I have a daily note in which I keep track of the important events that happened in my day, and my behavior in those events. At the end of the day, I review it, and make a list of things I did well and things I could have done better. This allows me to learn from successes and mistakes.

**Capturing important ideas.** Whenever I think of something important or someone says something important, I write it down in a note. Then, when I go and review them, I will be able to think about them more deeply and understand more things about them.[^7] This does not have to be limited to writing notes, it can also be taking photos, writing poetry, drawing; the central idea is to capture your experiences in a form that can be re-experienced later.

**Active reflection.** When I have an idea that's really troubling me or really amazing, I like to spend time dedicated to thinking about it. This is especially important when the idea is overwhelming, and is heavily impacting my life. For example, I thought one of my recent internships was really instrumental in a large part of my growth this summer, so spent some time asking myself questions about it[^8] and spent 15-20m honestly answering each of them in a notes doc. This really got me thinking about it, and helped me uncover two generalizations. Another thing I’m doing recently along this line is posing myself a question, walking around for a bit to think about it, coming back to my computer and writing down what I thought, and then repeating.[^9] I find that walking gets my body moving and gives me a nice change of scenery that is interestingly conductive to reflection thinking.

**Discussion.** Talking with others has been a deceptively amazing way to get ideas flowing; sometimes someone will get me to explain something, and through being forced to put my ideas into words at that moment, I am creating new representations of those ideas. This effect is further magnified when we discuss the ideas and disagree; I would then have to either mutate my ideas or explain them with more precision than previously.  

***Generally when we read about new ideas, we interpret them in bad faith (not necessarily a bad thing), so the best way to understand my ideas is to actually try them out :)***

[^1]:  The act of reflection is also just as easy as flipping a light switch, which makes me wonder why not everyone does it (I’m pretty sure lots of people do it already).

[^2]:  Imo, what's hard about learning is just building that intuition; sometimes the underlying fundamentals behind an idea are not clear to me, and it takes some time to really feel it. 

[^3]:  As I am doing now (hopefully)!

[^4]:  to create trust and therefore connection

[^5]:  Will write about this soon!

[^6]:  At some point in the last year, I got really upset at myself for sleeping late sometimes, especially when I got sick or was very tired. When I was feeling the negative effects of my previous actions, I would lament about my experience. However, since I did not internalize the feelings, later, when faced with the decision to repeat the action, I never actually remembered the experiences or cared to look at the reflections, and continued unimpeded. What really allowed me to make change was that act of internalization by spending time thinking about the negative experiences, and (unrelated) using willpower to stop and think before repeating the action.

[^7]:  On a side note, I have a notes doc called “writing” in which I put anything interesting to write about, and whenever they get substantial enough to write something on (like right now), I go and write it into an essay type thing.

[^8]:  Ex: Why am I not performing as well as I thought I would in this environment I should be doing well in? How much do I still have to learn from them? Why am I sometimes demotivated to work when the work is so interesting and rewarding? What mistakes have I made so far? These can be easily generated by language models as well.
