Even though I frequently lose them, my water bottles are dearly important to me. Because I lose them a lot, I have many, but my favorite one is aqua, semi-see-through, medium sized, with a handle for easy carrying and a lid on top that makes a satisfying pop each time I close it.

At a basic level, they serve immense utility compared to its cost. It reminds and constantly allows me to hydrate my body, which is especially important while playing sports,[^1] as well as providing me with a healthier and cheaper alternative to overpriced drinks at restaurants. They are also satisfying to use; I love flipping it in the air just like I flip my tennis racquet. I can even use them to get out of a conversation in a social event.

On a deeper level, they reveal many of my personality traits. Being efficient is very pleasing for me, and my water bottle is a great representation of that: the cheap, all in one item that never fails and always rewards.[^2] Another trait of mine that it reveals is my desire for autonomy. When I have my water bottle, I can sustain myself for extended periods of time even if I’m not at home, and that makes me feel safe and prepared. Furthermore, it shows my take on climate activism. At school and everywhere else, I have heard many many gruesome facts and arguments about our climate, and while I am not necessarily convinced that I should give my life to the fight[^3] I still want to help. Reusing my water bottle every single day helps reduce waste from plastic water bottles, all while benefiting me because I don’t have to get a new plastic bottle every time I’m thirsty (something that also pleases my efficiency wired brain).[^4]

[^1]:  That first swig after a long run or long point is SO FUCKING GOOD.

[^2]:  Just think of the uses: hammer, weapon, weight, ice pack, all on top of helping you hydrate. 

[^3]:  I am pretty selfish when it comes to me v.s. an extremely large collective that does not directly impact me, especially if my actions aren’t really perceived to help all that much and cost a lot for me.

[^4]:  Another example: I won’t go out of my way to not eat animals, but I *will* try my very best to finish all of the food on my plate, even if it tastes bad, because it is relatively easy for me (and also because sometimes that unpleasant food can be good for me, another win win!).
