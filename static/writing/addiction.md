# Intro

Just like with confidence, I have a lot of experience with addiction. To hopefully better other’s lives and to reflect on how it impacted me, I wanted to share my experiences, thoughts, and strategies relating to addiciton.

# My experience with addiction

Ever since I was little, I was always addicted to some kind of video game. It had always been a point of contention between me and my parents. In third grade, I bought $250 worth of gear in [Pixel Gun 3D](https://pixelgun3d.com/) while playing at night without telling her. She was furious. During the pandemic it got much worse; I started playing Hypixel (on Minecraft Java Edition), Clash of Clans, and Clash Royale all the time. My parents didn’t know what to do with me. They were not strict with me in general whatsoever, but this was one of the outliers.

On top of these consistent time sinks, there would also be video based distractions I would pour my time into as well. YouTube has always been by my side, providing me with amazing educational content, but also consistently interesting but useless videos that build up to take up insane amounts of time. I don’t remember specifically, but I’m pretty sure I was scrolling TikTok regularly at some point during the pandemic, and most recently, if I somehow get on to YouTube shorts,[^1] that's an hour or more lost.

I believe that because of these extreme hijackings of my dopamine system, I am more susceptible to other forms of addiction. For example, if you gave me a (very large) bowl of M\&M’s or Hershey’s Kisses one year ago, without thinking about it, I could eat all of them in one hour.[^2] It was just impulsive to keep taking them and eating them, because it felt good to do so, just like video games or video based distractions. This would happen with other snacks around the house—usually leftover from parties—like cookies, cupcakes, other chocolates, candies, and if I was lucky, fruit. Another example is work. I was talking about it with one of my teachers, we both admitted to gravitating toward the simple, satisfying tasks on our to-do lists while avoiding the harder but more meaningful work. This felt very similar to lots of previous examples because it rewarded you for being lazy. A final example is scratching itches. To me, it is the final boss of all addiction. Damage is done so quickly that you literally don’t even have time to think before it's over and you can’t do anything about it. They also heal so quickly that you don’t have time to really reflect on what you have done.

I have made numerous efforts to quell my addictions. Many of my anti-addiction strategies in the past have been destructive acts. These include deleting worlds (on Minecraft and Terraria), deleting all app data and customizations, giving away all my items in certain persistent games, throwing away perfectly good snacks, and completely blocking YouTube.[^3] These follow from the YOLO strategy described [here](https://www.moonflowers.xyz/writing/how_confidence_changed_my_life#:~:text=YOLO). I found that this strategy worked for large scale goals like “don’t mess up your other commitments (for the time being)”, but it didn’t change my fundamental relation with addiction. 

# Thoughts on addiction

## Is addiction inherently bad?

**Due to the constant conflict with my parents over addictive things, they have ingrained this idea that they are inherently bad**. This is an interesting idea, because they can be good but also inherently bad. It just depends on what your goals are. It's clear on how they can be good, but I will explain how they can be inherently bad. If you don’t already know, the goal of these distractions—and the fundamental reason they are so addictive—is that they want to addict you. They are spending lots of money to design these products that will make you use them. Thus, if your goal is to not be distracted from your goals ever, assuming that being distracted by these things is not part of your goals, they will always be at opposites with what you stand for. However, if you can completely resist the temptation of addiction, addictive things suddenly lose their veil of darkness and can be useful just like non addictive things. (My answer to the question is: it depends.)

### Pleasure is weird

**Also, pleasure is a pretty relative and a weird thing that humans experience**. Along with pain, it forms an intuitive guide book to surviving and reproducing in life. However, humans now have these cool things called thinking that bypasses all of these needs. Though they are still helpful sometimes because we would rather be thinking about more important things than “don’t hit your head on the lamp” all the time, they cause addiction and a whole plethora of other problems. Another weird thing about it is that it’s super relative. After experiencing a level of pleasure for a long time, we adapt to it, and now crave more; after all, we are fundamentally creatures that detect change.[^4] Thus what matters isn’t really objectively what kind of pleasure you are getting, but instead what kind of pleasure differentials you are getting. For example, if I only played video games and sometimes had a better time that others, it would be identical to if I only did work and sometimes did more fun work than usual. That’s a weird idea.

## Which addiction is worse?

I like to think of two spectrums for each addiction: **value assigning** and **difficulty**. These two spectrums are for how easy it is to get addicted and not about the subjective worseness after you are addicted for the sake of staying somewhat objective.

Firstly, the more the thing makes you care about something, the more dangerous it is. I have always pondered how Clash of Clans made me so upset when I couldn’t log on to make an upgrade or make my daily attacks to get more loot in sixth grade. **Then I realized that I literally cared more about data on my iPad than my parents.**[^5] To me, they were just a barrier to my play time. At the time I never even thought about this because the animals in my brain were clouding all of my thinking,[^6] but now thinking, that is **extremely scary**.

On top of that, another way of thinking about its potency is the spectrum of difficulty. **When something is difficult, dopamine hits are not guaranteed**, and long streaks of not getting dopamine hits discourages users. While inconsistency and randomness helps form many addictive behaviors, too much of it causes you to lose interest, very quickly. All addictive things have to be *relatively* easy, or in other words, easier than your normal activities, because otherwise you would just do those and get dopamine hits that way.

## Addiction is hard

It’s greatly unfortunate that so much of human brains are made specifically for surviving and reproducing in the wilderness. Thus, **our brains are not well made to deal with these kinds of things**. It's also unfortunate that products these days are designed—with care, extensive procedures, and money—to addict you. Those two things combined make it hard to get out of and even hard to realize addiction is acting on you. To deal with it, you really **need to spend time and thinking power** on it.

## Addiction is important

**Messing with your brain messes with you on a fundamental level**. Thus you really need to spend time and thinking power on it.

# Strategies for combating addiction

Disclaimer: I don’t promise that these will work. I’m not a neurologist or whatever. These are just strategies that worked for me that I want to share in hopes that it can help someone else.

## Overall Game Plan

In my life, I want to be able to complete goals and follow guidelines that I set. The point of removing addiction is to be able to pursue my goals better. Thus, the ultimate desire here is to **minimize distraction from my goals caused by addiction**. To achieve this, there are two big frameworks for change. 

## Strategies for learning immunity

Learning the ability to not be affected by addictions that are distracting me from my goals is a great way to go about this in the long run because in your life **you will always interact with addictive things, no matter how hard you try to avoid them**. This is what I realized was a better strategy after having to completely shut down my addictive activities many many times.[^7] The overall strategy was motivated from a crazy disconnect between the me that thinks clearly and the me that behaves impulsively. 

### Track your behavior

**If you don’t know that you are spending a lot of time on something, you won’t be able to combat it**. Sometimes after a long session of Minecraft or YouTube, I wouldn’t really know how long I spent on it. It became this vague idea of “oh yeah I lost some time doing this.” The next day, I would completely forget about it because it never bothered me. This may be a stop watch that is started everytime you start playing a video game, or a log of your thoughts after eating too much. In this step, you aren’t really required to take any action, that comes with the next two steps.

This first step of tracking your behavior may be all you need. If the results are so horrific (ex: 4h a day of Minecraft) that you just stop on the spot, great\! Conversely, it could also be the case that even though you spend some time playing a game with your friends, you really enjoyed the connection and value that over other things. Then you wouldn’t really need to continue with the proccess, because doing the thing isn’t contradictory to your goals.

### Understand your behavior

**Now that you have data about how this behavior is impacting you, ask yourself some questions to understand its properties**. Where does it come from? Why do I do it? Is this something that I value? Why should I care about removing it? Hopefully honestly answering[^8] these questions will help you realize a) what is causing you to be addicted to the thing, b) what you think about that, and c) why you should care about removing it. Here, we will draw a distinction between clear thinking you and impulsive you.[^9] I hope you get this analogy—imagine the you that was about relapse in your addiction due to a strong craving. Then imagine an upset you but after relapsing. These are two completely different people. Here we want to make clear thinking you completely understand and be on board with removing the addiction. We will wrangle impulsive you in the next section.

### Deliberate your behavior

Though probably not unique, my way of dealing with impulsiveness is through deliberation. Basically, **every time impulsive me is about to do something dumb, I try to have clear thinking me hold on to the reigns for some more time**. This makes sense because clear thinking me is the me that thinks more clearly and therefore can better my life in meaningful and optimizing ways, while impulsive me just wants to optimize for the immediate succeeding moments.

**This is really hard**. The hard part isn’t thinking about it and defeating impulsive me, the hard part is stopping impulsive me in the first place. Impulsive me knows that a) stopping is annoying because it delays the rewards and b) if we stop we might not get the rewards due to being defeated by clear thinking me, so as long as it’s in cockpit, things are bleak. The solution to this problem is to **train clear thinking you to not let impulsive you into the cockpit**. I can think of many times where I was working, but then suddenly I craved a cookie or to play video games. In that important moment, because I was so used to just giving in, I let clear thinking me leave the cockpit. That was my crucial mistake. 

## Strategies for removing

Learning immunity may not always be practical or optimal, especially if addiction is disrupting your life so much that just stepping away from it completely in one go would be better. The following are strategies for removing or attempting to remove the addictions directly.

### [YOLO](https://www.moonflowers.xyz/writing/how_confidence_changed_my_life#:~:text=YOLO)

If that’s hard (which it is), then 

### Replacement

Initially, abstinence is a great way to achieve the first goal, but even that is difficult. You can try a) replacing the addiction with things you enjoy, or b) replacing people you interact with that participate in the addictive thing, or at least decreasing your interaction with them while they are doing it.

For me, these were never things I did myself (I always just went for YOLO right away), but these were things that my parents tried to do for me when I was really addicted to video games. While I was never the driver of it, thus making it ineffective, I think it really helped me take that initial step to climbing out of the hole, as my parents say. Only then could I really understand what was happening to me to reach this stage, where I am thinking about stuff like deliberation.

# todo for edits

Imagine if there was an itch on your head and you notice it but dont do anything because you understand

* —imagine you start craving for a piece of cake or a donut or playing video games but you understand

Starting to do it, FEELS SUPER GOOD  
The ultimate boss of addiction is not scratching, its thinking

* The less friction to doing the thing, the easier it is to just do it impulsively (difficulty)  
* Solve thinking all the time can make thinking much more efficient

Talk about experience of having the kitchen staff have the popsicles \-\> dont really eat popsicles anymore  
meditating in mosquito storm  
Talk more about eating

* Eating dad’s food, waiting, then eating more (ultra full) (all the food coma)  
* Binge on snacks like it wasnt anything  
* Its a miracle im not fat yet  
  * Lots of sports during the year

Also a really good point of the humanist perspective in which some desires that you have like dopamine hits from food or video games are based and will actually make you happier if you dont beat yourself up about it like this

[^1]:  I never go to it on my own because of StayFocusd, but people send them around a lot.

[^2]:  I really really don’t like the after taste of sweet things nowadays so it might take two hours of eating a couple then drinking some water and repeating.

[^3]:  For YouTube and YouTube shorts, I have used two different blockers: [Cold Turkey](https://getcoldturkey.com/) and [StayFocusd](https://www.stayfocusd.com/), which have both worked pretty well. 

[^4]:  On a funny side note, I find snacks like Welch’s fruit snacks very interesting in this regard. For those who don’t know, they are small bags of sweet gummy candy. I would sometimes see others eat many bags of them in short periods of time. I never understood why until I tried it. After eating one bag, you craved for more. And this wasn’t just normal craving, you *craved* for more. My guess is that you usually ate them when you were a least a bit hungry, and after eating one, your brain thinks it’s eating time. But because they are not filling at all, you would just keep eating them. The more I thought about it, the more I saw a simmilarity between it and drugs. They were both very addictive, both are not healthy for the user, but one of them was shamed constantly and the other was completely accepted. 

[^5]:  It sounds really bad but in the moment it was definitely true.

[^7]:  A good metaphor is when you are trying to eradicate a tumor, removing it would help, but if you don’t get all of the cancer cells, then it will always come back. The better way to deal with it would be to have some kind of disease that spreads quickly through cancer cells and kills them all. (again im not a doctor or anything so i have no idea if any of this is accurate)

[^8]:  For this step, it is incredibly important that you are completely honest to yourself about your tendencies and impulses so as to make correct conclusions about your use.
