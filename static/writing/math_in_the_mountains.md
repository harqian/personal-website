# preface

When first seeing [this reflection](https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c2477476h3345839_math_in_the_mountains) written by a counselor for [math in the mountains](https://www.mathmountains.org/), I was both confused and skeptical. Fifteen hour days? How much camp could camp throw at you? Little did I know I would experience the same thing. Anyways, I thought it was so interesting that I decided that I too want to write a piece reflecting on my (very cool) experience at MitM.

(no bullet point summary because that feels unfitting for this kind of writing)

# middle part

Whenever people ask me, i always tell them that it was an amazing experience; this is wholly true. The long hours did not at all take away from the amazing kids, other counselors, faculty, guest speakers, and activities

* Kids \-\> energetic, fast, motivated  
* Other counselors \-\> friendly, smart, funny, inspiring  
* Faculty \-\> other counselors++  
* Guest speakers \-\> create a magical environment for thinking and exploration, also very inspiring  
* Activities \-\> great bonding experiences, nice breaks from math (monotony bad)

Also, generally, having very little time to do things is motivating for me

Being a part of this community and interacting with other great people helped me develop a lot of cool ideas, and generally had me very inspired and productive

It was also a great time to try out many new experiences, like intentionally showing gratitude, needing to think very carefully about what i do with the kids, and applying ideas from [confidence](http://moonflowers.xyz/writing/how_confidence_changed_my_life) in a relatively high stakes environment.

I think what was unique about the experience was that everyone was extremely wholesome and open, which allowed the community to flourish. This happens in other places, but here it was a completely different level; the kids were at an age where they were still very happy and somewhat naive, but most importantly, filled with energy. [As I wrote in a poem,](https://www.moonflowers.xyz/poetry/new_camp) i saw my younger self in the kids, which was an amazing reflective experience

From reflecting and interacting with others, i learned so much, from fun random math puzzles, to deeply beautiful math (and non-math) concepts to generalizations for learning and intellect to ways to best communicate with others to how i should apply some of my strategies best in new environments. Specifically the new experiences were really great in broadening my world view and understanding.
