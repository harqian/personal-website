# Intro

I used to not feel safe at school, and didn’t feel comfortable sharing things about life and reaching out to others. As a result, I didn't make any close friends and a lot of times, my growth was stunted. Now, I have completely changed, and in the process, realized it was because I was more confident. I will describe my idea of confidence, dispel some potential concerns, enumerate its benefits, and then share some stories about my experiences with this idea and my strategies for implementing this idea. 

# What is confidence?

In my own words, being confident is not fearing rejection or judgment. This definition connects to the normal definition of confidence given by “sureness of oneself and/or one's own abilities; self-esteem”, but is not necessarily interchangeable with it. As always, all things are good in moderation, but I argue that lack of confidence—in this case meaning an excessive fear of rejection or judgment—is extremely common in today’s society. Also, it is important to note that my experiences and a handful of others’ make up all the research I have done into this topic.

# Concerns

An obvious concern with this fearlessness is the idea that you will be judged and rejected. While the negative feelings resulting from these are totally legitimate, it is important to take a step back from the problem and ask yourself why you care. I might write on this later, but I think spending time reflecting on your life and what drives you is extremely important for overall success and also getting your goals straight so you can focus on them better. If your definition of success is based in others’ perceptions of you, I would seriously reconsider. However, completely getting rid of this attachment is incredibly difficult because of our socially wired brains, so instead of saying “just deal with it”, I will say some words in the next two sections to help mitigate this hurt with the power of logic. 

## Oh no, I’m going to get judged!

To this I have three things to say:

First, your current idea of what people will judge you for is almost certainly faulty. While I don’t have evidence for this, it makes logical sense. There are so many diverse people you interact with that your aggregate perception cannot accurately capture each of their judgment systems. Additionally, the thoughts that people act on are only a small subset of all their thoughts, so you would have no way of knowing many of their more personal judgments.[^1] This goes both ways—there will be things people judge you for that you didn’t think they would, and there will be things people wouldn’t judge you for that you thought they would. Thus, you would be getting judged anyway, so you might as well not be afraid of being judged.[^2]

This calculus also includes the fact that many times, perceived judgment is in fact just miscommunication. Think about it—you ask a friend if they want to do something, and they say no; “damn. guess i just don't do that again”, but they were just busy and didn’t take the time to show their interest in your proposal before rejecting it. Another scenario: the typical stranger standoff. You are at a party and see someone standing looking at their phone. You want to talk to them but think they don’t want to talk. Now you are just standing there awkwardly, so better quickly find something to do (stare aimlessly at your phone, get a drink, etc). Now check out their perspective—same thing—other person who would be fun to talk to[^3] is now doing something “productive”, so you definitely can’t talk to them.[^4]

![][image1]

Second, you control who you interact with, and thus who gets to judge you. I have found that, if you are intentional about it, you can find people that will basically not judge you. I estimate that at my school, the base average judgment percent[^5] is 20% for students and 10% for teachers.[^6]  By selecting who I want to talk to and avoiding those that make me feel bad,[^7] I have dropped those numbers to around 5% and 1%. 

Here’s an explanation for why these numbers would be so low, and more importantly, lower than you think: judging is harmful. And you know what harm does? It pushes people away. That's not something you want to be doing if you want to build connections, and building connections is generally a positive thing to do. This effect is magnified when the person realizes that they have judged others in the past. Unless they straight up like to hurt others, this realization will guide people towards being less judgmental in the future, or at least being less outwardly judgmental. Basically, judging is bad for the person doing the judging, too, and that makes them do it less overall.

(Also, I’m pretty sure there are countless psych studies done revealing our overthinking tendencies in relation to embarrassing events[^8])

Third, and arguably the most important, “weird” is relative. Something is weird only if people that you talk to think it's weird.[^9] Guess who can influence what the people you talk to think? That's right, you. The simple act of saying something and then acting like it's not weird (which is really important, because if you act like you’re unsure, they won’t necessarily be convinced) will directly influence their opinion on the matter. Humans are sheep; they follow the herd.[^10] This also goes for changing your appearance (new clothes, new glasses, new hairstyle, etc)—people like what's normal; I swear I see different people show up to school with drastically different looks, but then after a month it feels normal again.

To my surprise, so many things I was nervous about saying or doing have not at all been judged by the people around me, and I explain it to myself through these three arguments. This includes sharing my music taste, talking about being really unproductive, not knowing how to type in qwerty (colemak on top!), not knowing the meaning of certain words, not caring about fashion, and starting to wear glasses. All of these things I was really nervous about at some point, but then I started talking about them with people I know, and they never judged me at all about it.

## Oh no, I’m going to get rejected!

Being rejected is not a bad thing. Let’s think for a moment what being rejected means. If you are applying for a job, and are not offered the position, it could be for a plethora of reasons, but ultimately, they all point to the fact that the organization is not interested in hiring you. This can be generalized to many scenarios; from rejection you learn that someone or something is not interested in you.[^11] Many times, this is definitely not useless. It can help you gauge your abilities (assuming that you tried your best[^12]), narrow down your options, and decide what is realistic for you.

If you happen to desire growth, achievement, or improvement of any sort, rejection is sure to be in your future. I might even say that without rejection, those three things will be catastrophically impaired. Not sure how many famous people have said this yet, but you can’t win if you don’t try, and trying is what allows succeeding (and causes failing).[^13] 

If you happen to desire exceptional accomplishment, here are two more arguments. For exploration, there are many stories of famous thinkers who had correct ground-breaking theories but were ridiculed for them.[^14] While they are few and far between, they set a precedent for impact: if you want to do important, prestigious things, you will be rejected a lot. Especially if you are optimizing for speed or discovery. For access to elite environments like top universities, prestigious summer camps, or research internships at top labs,[^15] you will also get rejected lots. It feels pretty intuitive to me, but to explain: by conventional definitions of “prestigious”, the number of applicants dwarfs the number of institutions, so you have to be putting yourself out there and apply because it's not feasible for those organizations to come search for you.[^16] You are going to be applying to so many things and through modeling their decisions with random variables,[^17] due to variance and a relatively low chance of success, rejections will be guaranteed. 

Side note (not less important than anything else): I also believe that if you aren’t confident, the people will judge and reject you more. Many judgments are subconscious, and being confident subconsciously makes people associate you with success and stability, decreasing their chances of judging you. The inverse should also be true. For rejection, either you are being interviewed and the interviewer judges you for your lack of confidence, or you are applying for something, are afraid of rejection, so you doubt your abilities, and thus write a worse application. 

# Benefits

In the next section I will discuss how not being afraid of judgment or rejection can really propel your efficiency, growth, and happiness.

## Efficiency

Not spending time dwelling on your mistakes and planning out your every step saves time. Shocker. There is a time for perfection, but it shouldn’t be the default, especially when time is of the essence. When I asked someone I look up to how they stay efficient in their work, they said “I kind of just execute.” I was kind of on that track when talking to them about it, but the way they put it encapsulates the idea very well. On top of that, a lot of this time that you save is thinking time, which is more valuable than work time. This is the time that you can use to brainstorm, evaluate, and plan.

Not being afraid of making mistakes can not only save time, but also prevent lost opportunity.[^18] In any relationship, I always like to be honest and communicate often. *“Often? Don’t you mean clearly?”* There is no universally accepted standard for “clear” communication. Even if there was one, you still can’t ensure that your communication recipient actually understands it. The only way to do that is to ask. Especially over text where the element of body language and tone of voice is lost (which, by the way, makes up a lot of human communication according to many sources), miscommunication is ever-present. I wish I could share some funny miscommunication stories to convince you, but they are so common that I never record any good ones. 

Here are some great phrases I use commonly: “Do you understand what I mean by that?” “Are we clear on the expectations for \_\_\_\_?” “Do you actually want to work on this project?” “I’ll respond to this later.” Examples of this idea include following up on unreplied emails and texts (I used to hate doing this, but it has worked out so many times that the fear has completely disappeared), asking for what you want,[^19] ensuring team members are on the same page, and asking questions when you are uncertain. I have also seen that the more I do this, the more it is reciprocated, which makes my job much easier—I’m not having to always ask for clarification on their thoughts.

Also, when people are scared, they generally perform worse, especially in deeply intellectual activities. A good example of this is having a runny nose without any tissues; I would be constantly thinking about it instead of let’s say a math project I was doing in class.[^20] It’s not just that I was completely not thinking about my project—even a runny nose would not do that to me[^21]—the fact that I was being distracted, even momentarily, broke my chain of thought. This costs a lot when deep thinking is required. This might also apply to nervousness in performances (music, sports, presentations), but a lot of those are based on muscle memory, and I’m not really sure how those relate to confidence; if you know, please let me know!

## Growth

The main idea in this section is that confidence allows you to make meaningful changes to your life. This can let you accept your weaknesses and work on them, learn cool things, and reorganize your thinking. Specifically for working on weaknesses, it’s really important that you are able to accept them, because fully understanding them makes it much easier to improve. Overall, confidence contributes a carefree and empowering aspect to your mindset that makes growth much easier; you should just do whatever makes your life better and not worry about anything else. It allows you to focus solely on what’s important.

I have understood this idea in different ways many times in my life, and each time, I used it to positively change my life. 

The first time was learning colemak. I never learned qwerty correctly when I was in middle school (didn’t understand the importance of discipline when doing typing practice), and at some point, I decided that while my typing was pretty fast, it was annoying because I constantly needed to look at the keyboard to plan my next stroke. After realizing this, I made a plan to learn how to touch type on a new keyboard layout, and executed that plan. Nowadays, I type very speedily in colemak, and have thought about learning qwerty again.

The second time was self-exploring subjects. In freshman year, I started spending a lot of time learning stuff like math, computer science, piano, and ultimate frisbee due to enjoying them. My confidence, mostly from previous self-learning experience, was what allowed me to learn very quickly—I could focus on strategies for learning and actually spend my time thinking about the topics without worrying about what people would think of me if they knew I enjoyed learning. Additionally, even if it was a hard problem or project, I would just think it through and trust my abilities to be able to either learn/do it or, having tried my best, pivot to something else.

The third time was realizing I should never be afraid of stopping someone in their thoughts if they mentioned something I didn’t know. This goes for friends, teachers, guest speakers, strangers, interviewers[^22], people younger than you; anyone. First, given that you don’t know the thing they are talking about, asking is a great way to learn! Here you are, chatting with this person who presumably knows at least a good amount about the thing, and you completely ignore a perfectly great opportunity to improve your knowledge, their knowledge (through their explanation), and the connection between you two through shared understanding and discussion, all to save a bit of embarrassment.[^23] Second, this puts you in a very awkward spot at the end of the conversation. You can either admit you didn’t understand anything, which would be super awkward but still help you learn a little and connect a little, or don’t. If you don’t you can never talk to them again because they will always assume you understood what they said in that one conversation you had with them.[^24] A similar idea is asking people to make text on a projection bigger because I can’t see it, but I still haven’t internalized this one yet.

The fourth time was realizing the ideas from the second realization could be applied to things as big as my life goals and my habits. I had recently talked to a high school senior and college sophomore about how to think about your place in the world and what to do with your life, and reflected on my life. It really helped me stay disciplined (step away from playing video games in a cyclic manner, stop eating lots of sweets randomly) because I used different logical bases to determine four guidelines for my life which those indulgences conflicted with. Confidence aided this goal setting through allowing me to do what I want and believe in myself. 

These realizations have taught me invaluable lessons.

## Happiness

While it may seem the least “useful”, happiness was probably what I gained most out of this transition.

Not worrying about random stuff all the time is super liberating. Like I said in a footnote somewhere earlier, I think fear is one of the most harmful emotions a human can experience. Removing that at least somewhat has made my life a lot better; I have realized that many things I used to really worry about I have either stopped worrying about for various reasons, or dealt with them directly.

Being able to take control of your life and not have it be dictated by others is similarly liberating to the lack of fear. The level of autonomy that setting my own goals and reevaluating my own life gave me is really what motivated me to write about this process (on top of being able to reflect on it just by writing about it).

Not only are these three pillars of benefits powerful on their own, they work together to create a truly unforgettable transformation. The opportunities you receive as a result of efficiency really help your growth. For example, I never realized how happy talking to people makes me until I started talking to a lot more people. Similarly, growing usually makes you more efficient by helping you focus on the things you want to work on. Being happy helps both efficiency and growth because being in a better mood is crucial for thinking and working. Growing and being more efficient are things that could also make you more happy. Thus, I think confidence is a self-sustaining system, meaning that the more confident you are, the more confident you will become.

# How it has impacted me

I’ve already talked a bit about my journey in the introduction and through examples sprinkled here and there in the body. To be unique, in this section I will discuss specific embarrassing experiences I have had while using this framework and how I dealt with them, as well as some strategies I used to stick to the framework.

## Experiences!

In 2024, I was at a casual performing arts event that my school hosted, and enjoyed music and performances with hot chocolate. After the planned performances, the remaining time was spent as an open mic. I had just learned “City of Stars” from La La Land, but I was still a beginner to piano and had never performed anything before. I said fuck it we ball and asked a girl I knew was a singer to sing it with me (because the song was originally with a male voice and female voice). Near the end of the event we got on stage and I messed up more than four times. While the crowd was very supportive, it was probably one of the most embarrassing things I’ve done up to that point in my life, and probably still now. I got a teacher to record my performance, and I only had the guts to watch the entire thing today to write this. Afterwards, I remember being very shocked and upset, and somehow (don’t ask me how) being able to go back to school and pretend like nothing happened. I kept telling myself that someday I would look back on it and laugh, and that it wouldn’t even be that detrimental to my social life. Both were true. As bad as it was, I learned that playing piano and singing at the same time is really hard especially if you are new to both, and that performing in general is tough. It was a valuable (and harsh) introduction to performing, something that I have never really done before. 

This year was my first year doing the whole process of applying to internships and camps for the summer. My strategy was to just apply to as many as possible, write about myself honestly for the sake of reflection. A lot of the applications were rushed because I started very late, so a lot of submissions were first drafts. That, combined with my inexperience was what I think caused a lot of them to be turned down. Despite this, I was able to fill my summer with some great activities. I also learned a lot about myself and writing while brain-dumping into my applications Google Doc, how to effectively spend unstructured time, and that unstructured time is super helpful for exploring my interests.[^25] 

My best friend once said that I have “unlimited social awkwardness capacity”. When she said that, I laughed, appreciated her for being honest, realized it was very true, and found that I was proud of it. I see social awkwardness as a barrier to opportunity, and if I can reach that opportunity, I’ll be worth getting tangled in however much awkwardness. Just like how I can’t share good stories of miscommunication, I can’t really share good stories of awkward social interactions because they are so insanely common. They are so frequent that I started really appreciating movie scenes that don’t have perfect communication and dialogue.[^26] Just think of all of the unreciprocated gestures, awkward (like, actually) silence, saying stupid stuff, walking in the wrong direction, trying to talk to someone while they are doing something, showing up to an event bringing the wrong things or dressed inappropriately, phone ringing randomly, forgetting peoples’ names (or worse, calling them by the wrong names); the average person has experienced all of them. There are infinitely more of these, and I might make a list and post it here later. 

## Strategies/Guidelines

### Logic

Many times when I am doubting myself, I find that the fears are mostly irrational. What if your best friend that you’ve known for five years doesn’t enjoy talking to you? What if I fail miserably? What if people hate/judge me for doing this? \*brain playing out scenarios where everything fails\* There is a lot of “what if” that is your amygdala talking. In these scenarios, you can question your beliefs and evaluate impact. Think deeply and honestly about why you think you can’t do something, what evidence you have for a suspicion, or what something will do to you.

### YOLO

This is a strategy I have used countless times in my life. I like to be decisive for the sake of efficiency, and many times I just say “whatever” and do something potentially embarrassing. For me, it's motivated by the fact that past mistakes have not really been that bad, and the fact that experiencing different things is a good thing to do. In fact, I think it's exceedingly important —just as important as learning or growing. Funnily enough, last year I learned about the concept of catharsis, and I’ve been using it ever since to put myself through stressful (but overall positive or necessary) situations such as watching the video of me failing at performing, or reading distressing books.

### Take it easy

This process doesn't have to be fast. It wasn't fast for me; it took around two years for me to fully understand the idea and use it in my everyday life. Even now, I still have things I don’t share openly with others, but like I said, it's a self-sustaining process—I’m getting better every day. I want to clarify; I’m not saying the more openness the better, I’m saying that not sharing anything can be harmful and encouraging everyone to at least try sharing to see if they like it or not. My strategy for this was to start small. I would go up to a teacher one day and ask about a topic that was interesting to me or share something embarrassing with my best friend. This slowly snowballed into what I am comfortable with today.

# Conclusion

This is going to be light because hopefully you read the entire thing (if you didn’t, get some LLM to make you a conclusion). I think this trait is one that sets people up for success, and it might be tough, but just work bit by bit and as long as you are making progress, you can learn it just like any other skill.

P.S. I did not realize this when writing about it, but this topic has been thoroughly discussed in the past. Just search “is confidence important” or “benefits of confidence” on the internet. [1](https://www.trine.edu/academics/centers/center-for-sports-studies/blog/2023/the_relationship_between_self-confidence_and_performance.aspx) [2](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/thicken-your-skin/201509/the-essence-confidence) [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9306298/) [4](https://drneilthompson.medium.com/the-importance-of-confidence-879e548116aa) [5](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/tuzbfh/why_is_confidence_important/) [6](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/shyness-is-nice/201809/why-self-confidence-is-more-important-you-think) [7](https://www.drivanjoseph.com/blog/if-you-don-t-believe-in-yourself-who-will) [8](https://www.sonaldave.com/blog/5-reasons-confidence-is-important/) [9](https://roughnotes.com/rnmagazine/2008/august08/08p036.htm) [10](https://www.momsgotmoney.com/the-importance-of-self-confidence/)

[^1]:  Other than perfectly replicating their entire brain as well as perfectly transferring their current brain state into your clone of their brain, and then deriving a perfect mapping between neuronal activity and concept space, which should only really take three philosophers and a neuro startup guy.

[^2]:  imo, fear is one of the most harmful emotions, worse than anger and sadness by a long shot.

[^3]:  I mean, what’s a party if not for socializing? Right?

[^4]:  Thus as person two, you would need to immediately seize the moment when person one is momentarily not doing anything. That is the only way for the interaction to work out. For sure…

[^5]:  By this I mean “the average of the judgment rates of the people around you.”

[^6]:  This could be biased for the better as I recognize that most of the people at my school come from more privileged communities, but I don’t think that's important here.

[^7]:  Which should also be a general rule of thumb, even when not in the context of this theory

[^9]:  It would be pretty darn weird to think something is weird only because people you dont talk to and dont care about think it's weird :/ (and if you cite social media as a place where people you don’t talk to can judge you, you have on your hands a great reason not to use social media)

[^10]:  This is a really cool phenomenon to study; I think it's where a lot of slang comes from. You’d think stuff like “skibidi” and “sigma” is really weird, but a whole generation of people toss it around regularly, and that normalizes it in language. 

[^11]:  Now, before you say “*well I knew \_\_\_\_\_ wasn’t interested in me already*”, ask yourself—did you really? How can you know 100% without asking? How many times was your intuition on whether \_\_\_\_\_ was interested in you wrong—in either direction? At least for me, it has been a ginormous amount of times, for many different \_\_\_\_\_.

[^12]:  Which you should be doing always—a) it allows you to gauge your abilities like in this scenario, b) you can say “I tried” and not doubt yourself, c) you get MUCH better results, and d) it is more fulfilling.

[^13]:  There are SO many. Here are just a couple I found after searching for 4m on Google: “You can’t learn if you don’t try.” “Better to have failed than never tried.” “Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.” “R.I.P. to the opportunities we missed because of shyness & low self esteem.” “Try and fail, but don’t fail to try!” “Just keep trying. That's all you can do.”

[^14]:  Galileo with his theory of heliocentrism, Hippasus of Metapontum discovering irrational numbers (or so some sources claim), and Charles Darwin’s theory of natural selection are all great examples.

[^15]:  Not saying this is the right or only way of achieving in life, but it is a pretty darn common one, which is why I’m addressing it directly here.

[^16]:  And, as I have found recently, talent search is incredibly hard these days. Even if you were the smartest person in the entire world, if no one knew, you would never be able to be recognized for it. Thus you really have to put yourself out there to show your own talent.

[^17]:  Ever since I started learning about random variables in probability I have gained a new perspective on looking at life. Everything is a random variable, and there is always variance. Also the whole thing about Bayesian inference.

[^18]:  Quick ECON101 note: market efficiency in microeconomics is defined in relation to the volume of positive transactions between sellers and buyers. In this use of efficiency, I am describing positive interactions between people :)

[^19]:  I was recently at a social event, and 6 acquaintances were playing spike ball. I wanted to play, so I asked: “Does anyone not want to play?” One of them immediately said they didn’t want to play, and gave me a spot (I am very sure that I’m not insanely menacing and just scared them off). 

[^20]:  I’m not saying disregard it; some things are judged for good reason. I would go around trying to find napkins.

[^21]:  Thinking about girls would, though :P

[^22]:  “*What if they don’t give me the job because of it?*” If the question was worth asking, it would have shown you are capable of owning your growth and aren’t afraid to ask questions (employers usually want that kind of person). If the question was not worth asking (e.g. they want you to know it for the job) then since you didn’t know it, maybe the job isn’t for you.

[^23]:  There are definitely scenarios where this doesn’t make sense, like if you are making small talk with someone at an ultimate pickup game and don’t care about learning about the thing, don’t have much time to talk, and think that the contribution understanding makes to your connection isn’t that important. However, like the entire idea of confidence, I have observed that the general trend is to do this, so I am writing to persuade people to do otherwise.

[^24]:  Totally exaggerating—even then you should be confident and talk to them—but still it would be much weirder than asking that the first time.

[^25]:  \[insert copium meme here\] but in all seriousness it's not a bad thing
